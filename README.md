📌 1. Product Category Distribution (2023 vs 2024)

The distribution across categories seems fairly balanced, with no single product contributing disproportionately.

2024 shows a slight upward shift, indicating modest category expansion or improved recording.

The variation is small (0.1%–26.7%), meaning product demand is stable across categories.

→ Insight:
Product portfolio is well-balanced; any category-specific marketing can be targeted for slight optimization rather than major restructuring.

📌 2. Product Count by Region

North and East regions lead with the highest count of Product IDs (~270–280).

West and South trail slightly (~220–240).

→ Insight:
Sales penetration is highest in North/East. South may need targeted campaigns or distribution improvements.

📌 3. New vs Returning Customers by Region Count

New customers dominate with a slightly higher region count (~504 vs 496).

→ Insight:
Customer acquisition is strong, but retention needs attention.
Introducing loyalty programs or personalized offers could raise returning customer numbers.

📌 4. Sales Amount vs Discount

Sales amount oscillates sharply with increasing discount.

However, higher sales amounts appear around discounts of 0.15–0.25.

Low discounts (<0.05) yield moderate but stable sales.

→ Insight:
Mid-range discounts (15–25%) maximize sales.
Discounts beyond 25–30% don’t show a consistent upward trend → avoid over-discounting.

📌 5. Product Count by Region & Payment Method

Credit card usage is consistently high, especially in North and East.

Cash usage dips in the South.

Bank Transfers remain stable but lower comparatively.

→ Insight:
Digital payment adoption is strong → enable more online payment options, cashback integrations, or fintech partnerships.

📌 6. Quantity Sold (Jan 2023 – Q1)

Sales fluctuate across days, with peaks on days 11–13, exceeding 200 units.
